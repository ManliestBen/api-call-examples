### This template is set up for practice querying 3rd party APIs.  
### There are 3 basic routes/views along with a nav bar that have been configured as a template.
### Links to placeholder images have been used and should be replaced with data received in the API response.
## __Documentation for each of the APIs can be found here:__
### [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)
### [NASA APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/) - (free, but requires email to get API key)
### [Quickchart API](https://quickchart.io/)
